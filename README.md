Probabilistic process scheduling algorithm

A type of scheduling algorithm that is a probabilistic in nature, for scheduling processes in an operating system. Processes are each assigned some number of lottery tickets, and the scheduler draws a random ticket to select the next process. 
The benefit of the algorithm is that each process is given a proportional share of the CPU.
